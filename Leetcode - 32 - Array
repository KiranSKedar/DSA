NOtes :

1.first sort it so that u'll get the min difference easy
2.we check third & 1st element bcoz if it satisfies the condition 2nd one obivously satisfies it
if it doesn't satisfy then return empty (as we have to include all elements & if for even one element the condition won't satisfy we cannot include it in result)
